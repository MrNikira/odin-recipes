    <p>This is a copycat Tom Cruise cake, aka the white chocolate coconut Bundt cake that Tom Cruise sends every Christmas to a select list of friends — it is definitely worth jumping on a couch for in my opinion!</p>
    <h2>- Ingredients -</h2>
    <h3>Cake:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for flouring the pan</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>3 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>6 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coconut extract</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 cups sweetened flaked coconut</li>
        <li>1 cup white chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Frosting:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups sweetened flaked coconut</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>- Directions -</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the coconut cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt pan.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in whole eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla extracts, coconut extract, and sour cream: beat until combined.</li>
        <li>Add flour mixture and mix until just combined; fold in flaked coconut and white chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into the prepared pan and use the back of a spoon to spread batter evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour 25 minutes. Allow cake to cool in the pan for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely, about 2 hours more.</li>
        <li>To make the frosting: Add cream cheese, butter, vanilla, and salt to a medium bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Gradually add powdered sugar and slowly mix until incorporated. Add cream and beat until light and fluffy, about 1 or 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Frost the top and sides of the cake; lightly press coconut evenly around the outside. </li>
    </ol>
